This is a item check tracker for The Legend of Zelda:Majora's Mask Randomizer.
Specificly the randomizer created by ZoeyZolotova (https://github.com/ZoeyZolotova/mm-rando).
The idea is to create a tracker that can allow you to see which item checks you can collect with the current items in your desposel.
In addition, the tracker showes you where are said checks, what are the items required to collect them, the method to unlock them and the original reward for said quest.
The tracker also allowes you to mark which item are rewarded for each check (for cases of cycle resets, gossip stone hints, seeing an unreachable item, etc.).
The tracker also highlights items On The Way Of The Hero™ (good Items) and Foolish Choice™ items (bad items).

this tracker is **Heavily** Influenced by the tracker created by exudus122 (https://exodus122.github.io/mm-tracker/)
Overworld maps are taken from bluedart's texture pack (https://www.n64textures.com/downloads/#Zelda%20Majoras%20Mask%20(Bluedart)) because it the only place which hold the in game maps or atleast similar maps.
Temple maps are taken from zelda.com.br; those are (I think) the regular in game maps but I still wanna give them credit for being the only good source for relitvliy unobscured dungeon maps.

Of cource the program is only Intentional for use on randomized ROMs gotten from an official The Legend of Zelda®:Majora's Mask™ Nintendo 64™ cartritage, played on an official Nintendo 64™ Console While wearing official Nintendo© merchendize™.
